            <description><![CDATA[This article describes the evolution of bots in the GitHub world, their behaviors and characteristics, and the impact they have brought to the open source world.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to GitHub, we often see fake GitHub users who are always enthusiastic and active, giving timely feedback to project maintainers and contributors, and helping developers with tasks that can be automated. Yes, the next thing I want to discuss is something about GitHub bots.</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In the <a href="https://ossinsight.io/">OSSInsight</a> project, we have developed a number of metrics to provide insight into open source projects. When developing some open source project metrics, we always consider excluding bot-generated actions or events from the metric calculation. </p><p>However, We can&#x27;t ignore the contribution of robots in the domain of open source, and it&#x27;s important to shift our thinking to look at what bots are doing on GitHub.</p><p>GitHub bots help developers do a lot of work:</p><ul><li>Issue triage and management. (For example: <code>stale[bot]</code>„ÄÅ<code>todo[bot]</code>)</li><li>Code review, security audit and quality inspection (For example, <code>snyk-bot</code>).</li><li>Format checking like ensuring license agreement signing, or make sure  commit messages semantic. (For example: <code>CLAassistant</code>)</li><li>Integration with third-party systems, including Jira, Slack, Jenkins and so on.</li><li>As an agent to help contributor perform some operations needed permission on the repository. (For example: <code>k8s-ci-bot</code>„ÄÅ<code>ti-chi-bot</code>)</li></ul><h2>History trends</h2><p>Looking at the historical data, we see that the number of GitHub bots grows significantly faster after 2019 (on average, 20,000 new bots are created each year)</p><div chart="dynamic-line" query="bot-total-history" xIndex="event_year" yIndex="bots_total"></div><p>I looked into what happened during the year and found that GitHub invested a lot in its software development infrastructure (including bots) during the year.</p><ul><li><p>In May 23, 2019, GitHub announced acquired Dependabot (Aka, <code>dependabot[bot]</code>).</p></li><li><p>In June 17th, 2019, <a href="https://github.blog/2019-06-17-github-acquires-pull-panda/">GitHub announced acquired Pull Panda</a>.</p></li><li><p>In September 18th, 2019, <a href="https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/">GitHub announced acquired Semmle</a> (Aka, the team builded <code>lgtm-com[bot]</code>).</p></li></ul><p>At this year, we, humans beings, were amazed to discover that bots could find problems, submit PRs, wait CI test code, complete merges and comment on PRs on their own without any human involvement. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/buildo/react-components/pull/1367"><img src="./bot_automatically_completes_a_pull_request.png" alt="Bot automatically completes a pull request"/></a></p><p>For now, rough statistics found that there are more than 95,620 bots on GitHub, the number doesn&#x27;t seem like so much, but wait...</p><details><summary>Click here to show computational process</summary><p>Before that, we had collected 4.7 billion github events stored in our database. Now we can count the number of bots on GitHub by executing a simple SQL statement:</p><pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT actor_login) AS &#x27;Bots&#x27;

</code></pre><p>In this SQL statement, we use a regular expression to determine which <code>actor_login</code> is the robot login. For example, the well known star robot <code>dependabot[bot]</code>, whose github login ends with <code>[bot]</code>, we can find more bots among a large number of events based on this method.</p><pre><code>+-------+

Almost nothing was ever fixed and every few weeks I had to manually clickety-click to keep the issues alive because of the stale bot. Guess what I do now? I don&#x27;t report bugs to Gatsby, and I recommend against using Gatsby in newer projects.</p></blockquote></td><td><p>The user from NixOS:</p><blockquote><p>IMO NixOS has the right stalebot settings <sub><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/51">0</a></sub>. It was discussed thouroughly in the RFC, as to choose the right information text and other actions by the bot. For example, the bot will only mark the issue/PR as stale and will never close the issue or lock it. Issues are only ever closed by humans.
The information text they came up with is quite a bit longer than the ansible one <sub><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/92254">1</a></sub>. I think this is a very important point when adding such a bot, otherwise the user will be left helpless.</p></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></td></tr></table><p>To verify the above statement, we run the following query through the SQL statement:</p><pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT actor_login, COUNT(DISTINCT pr_or_issue_id) AS cnt

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>4.6 billion is literally an astronomical figure. The richest star map of our galaxy, brought by Gaia space observatory, includes just under 2 billion stars. What does a view of 4.6 billion GitHub events really look like? What secrets and values can be discovered in such an enormous amount of data? </p><p>Here you go: <a href="https://ossinsight.io/">OSSInsight.io</a><strong> can help you find the answer</strong>. It‚Äôs a useful insight tool that can give you the most updated open source intelligence, and help you deeply understand any single GitHub project or quickly compare any two projects by digging deep into 4.6 billion GitHub events in real time. Here are some ways you can play with it.</p><h2>Compare any two GitHub projects</h2><p>Do you wonder how different projects have performed and developed over time? Which project is worthy of more attention? <strong><a href="https://ossinsight.io/">OSSInsight.io</a></strong> can answer your questions via the <a href="https://ossinsight.io/analyze/pingcap/tidb">Compare Projects</a> page.</p><p>Let‚Äôs take the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes">Kubernetes repository</a>  (K8s) and Docker‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby">Moby repository</a> as examples and compare them in terms of popularity and coding vitality. </p><h3><strong>Popularity</strong></h3><p>To compare the popularity of two repositories, we use multiple metrics including the number of stars, the growth trend of stars over time, and stargazers‚Äô geographic and employment distribution. </p><h4><strong>Number of stars</strong></h4><p>The line chart below shows the accumulated number of stars of K8s and Moby each year. According to the chart, Moby was ahead of K8s until late 2019. The star growth of Moby slowed after 2017 while K8s has kept a steady growth pace. </p><p><img src="./the-star-history.png"/></p><center><em>The star history of K8s and Moby</em></center><h4><strong>Geographical distribution of stargazers</strong></h4><p>The map below shows the stargazers‚Äô geographical distribution of Moby and K8s. As you can see, their stargazers are scattered around the world with the majority coming from the US, Europe, and China.</p><p><img src="./geographicla-distribution-of-stargazers.png"/></p><center><em>The geographical distribution of K8s and Moby stargazers</em></center><h4><strong>Employment distribution of stargazers</strong></h4><p>The chart below shows the stargazers‚Äô employment of K8s (red) and Moby (dark blue). Both of their stargazers work in a wide range of industries, and most come from leading dotcom companies such as Google, Tencent, and Microsoft. The difference is that the top two companies of K8s‚Äô stargazers are  Google and Microsoft from the US, while Moby‚Äôs top two followers are Tencent and Alibaba from China.  </p><p><img src="./employment-distribution-of-stargazers.png"/></p><center><em>The employment distribution of K8s and Moby stargazers</em></center><h3><strong>Coding vitality</strong></h3><p>To compare the coding vitality of two GitHub projects, we use many metrics including the growth trend of pull requests (PRs), the monthly number of PRs, commits and pushes, and the heat map of developers‚Äô contribution time.  </p><h4><strong>Number of commits and pushes</strong></h4><p>The bar chart below shows the number of commits and pushes submitted to K8s (top) and Moby (bottom) each month after their inception. Generally speaking, K8s has more pushes and commits than Moby, and their number grew stably until 2020 followed by a slowdown afterwards. Moby‚Äôs monthly pushes and commits had a minor growth between 2015 and 2017, and then barely increased after 2018.</p><p><img src="./monthly-pushes-and-commits.png"/></p><center><em>The monthly pushes and commits of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center><h4><strong>Number of PRs</strong></h4><p>The charts below show the monthly and accumulated number of PRs of the two repositories. As you can see, K8s has received stable and consistent PR contributions ever since its inception and its accumulated number of PRs has also grown steadily. Moby had vibrant PR submissions before late 2017, but started to drop afterwards. Its accumulated number of PRs reached a plateau in 2017, which has remained the case ever since. </p><p><img src="./monthly-and-accumulated-pr-number.png"/></p><center><em>The monthly and accumulated PR number of K8s (top) and Moby (bottom)</em></center><h4><strong>Developers‚Äô contribution time</strong></h4><p>The following heat map shows developers‚Äô contribution time for K8s (left) and Moby (right). Each square represents one hour in a day. The darker the color, the more contributions occur during that time. K8s has many more dark parts than Moby, and K8s‚Äô contributions occur almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. K8s definitely has more dynamic coding activities than Moby. </p><p><img src="./heat-map.png"/></p><center><em>Heat map of developers‚Äô contribution time of K8s (left) and Moby (right)</em></center><br/><p><strong>Taken together</strong>, these metrics show that while both K8s and Moby are popular across industries world-wide, K8s has more vibrant coding activities than Moby. K8s is continuously gaining popularity and coding vitality while Moby is falling in both over time.</p><p>Popularity and coding vitality are just two dimensions to compare repositories.

To make things worse, the data volume is beyond traditional single node databases&#x27; reach.</p></blockquote><h2>Background</h2><p>To store large volumes of real-time user data like email and provide insights is not easy. If your application is layered on top of Gmail to automatically extract and organize the useful information buried inside of our inboxes.</p><p> It became clear that they were going to need a better system for organizing terabytes of email metadata to power collaboration as their customer base rapidly increased, it is not easy to provide insights. You need to organize email data by first applying a unique identifier to the emails and then proactively indexing the email metadata. The unique identifier is what connects the same email headers across. For each email inserted in real-time, the system extracts meta information from it and builds indices for high concurrent access. When data volume is small, it&#x27;s all good: traditional databases provide all you need. However, when data size grows beyond a single node&#x27;s capacity, everything becomes very hard.</p><h2>Potential Database Solutions</h2><p>Regarding databases, there are some options you might consider:</p><ol><li><strong>NoSQL database.</strong> While fairly scalable, it does not provide you indexing and comprehensive query abilities. You might end up implementing them in your application code.</li><li><strong>Sharing cluster of databases.</strong> Designing sharding key and paying attention to the limitations between shards are painful. It might be fine for applications with simple schema designs, but it will be too complicated for CRM. Moreover, it&#x27;s very hard to maintain.</li><li><strong>Analytical databases.</strong> They are fine for dashboard and reporting. But not fine for high concurrent updates and index based serving.</li></ol><h2>How to get real-time insights</h2><p><a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiDB</a> is a distributed database with user experience of traditional databases. It looks like a super large MySQL without the limitations of NoSQL and sharding cluster solutions. With TiDB, you can simply have the base information, indices and metadata being updated in a concurrent manner with the help of cross-node transaction ability. </p><p>To build such a system, you just need following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Create schemas</strong> according to your access pattern with indices on user name, organization, job title etc.</li><li><strong>Use streaming system</strong> to gather and extract meta information from your base data</li><li><strong>Insert into TiDB via ordinary MySQL client driver like JDBC.</strong> You might want to gather data in small batches of hundreds of rows to speed up ingestion. In a single transaction, updates on base data, indices and meta information are guaranteed to be consistent.</li><li>Optionally, <strong>deploy a couple of <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tiflash-overview?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">TiFlash</a> nodes</strong> to speed up large scale reporting queries.</li><li><strong>Access the data</strong> just like in MySQL and you are all done. SQL features for analytics like aggregations, multi-joins or window functions are all supported with great performance.</li></ol><p>For more cases, please see <a href="https://en.pingcap.com/customers/?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">here</a>.</p><p>:::info</p><h3>üåü Details in how OSS Insight works</h3><p>Go to read <a href="/blog/try-it-yourself">Use TiDB Cloud to Analyze GitHub Events in 10 Minutes</a> and use the <a href="https://tidbcloud.com/free-trial?utm_source=ossinsight&amp;utm_medium=referral">Developer Tier</a> <strong>free</strong> for 1 year.</p><p>You can find how we deal with massive github data in <a href="/blog/how-it-works">Data Preparation for Analytics</a> as well!
